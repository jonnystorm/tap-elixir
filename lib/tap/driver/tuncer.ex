  Sending a frame containing less than 14 bytes will quietly explode the tuncer
  process, destroying the corresponding TAP interface. Sending a frame with more
  than 4193920 bytes has the same effect. To avoid such subtleties, I've chosen
  to clarify both constraints with guards.

  Of course, none of this means you should actually send 4193920 bytes, and
  interfaces aren't usually configured to accept more than 1532 bytes anyway (MTU
   + 802.3 + 802.1Q + etc.).
